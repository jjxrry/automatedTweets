# Twitter bot

This is just the initial test to see if it works, i just want to have this be able to schedule a POST request at a random minute every couple of hours from a bank of prewritten tweets.

A big issue right now is the auth process, also finding out how to store authorization state for other users

current functionality:

- queue tweets
- adding tweets to queue 
- tweet archival after successful post

startup:

- clone the repo
- cd repo directory
- npm i
- write a tweet then call the tweetbot
